## Group Learning

One of the main aspects of our approach is group learning, which has a number of advantages compared to individual learning. Let's take a closer look at these benefits.

-   Group support and communication with colleagues with similar goals motivate and provide a sense of belonging. Accountability to the group - it's easy to break a promise to oneself, but being accountable to a group or a partner helps overcome laziness.
    
-   Group learning helps participants stay focused on their goals and provides the opportunity for discussion and joint problem solving. When participants see the progress of other group members, it stimulates their own development and supports the drive for continuous improvement.

-   Support and knowledge exchange - in a group, there are more chances to find help if you get "stuck" in the learning process.
    
-   Group training provides a structured schedule and time planning, which helps participants better organize their workload and learning. This approach makes the preparation process more manageable and allows participants to find the optimal balance between work, study, and personal life.

Thus, group learning has a positive impact on the motivation, goal achievement, and time management of the participants. Through collaborative work and experience sharing, members of our group grow and become stronger as professionals.
