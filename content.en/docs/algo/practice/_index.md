# Approaches to Practice

To get an idea of what approaches can be used for practicing solving algorithmic problems, let's look at the main stages of solving a problem in an interview. We focus on a typical Tech Screening - two medium-level problems for 20 minutes each.

1. Listen/Read the conditions 1min
2. Ask clarifying questions 2min
3. Construct examples 2min
4. Find a brute-force solution 30sec
5. Find an optimal solution 5min
6. Write the solution's API (code starter) 30sec
7. Write code 5min
8. Debug the solution on a new example 3min
9. Correct errors 1min

As we can see, in reality, we only have about 5 minutes (maximum 10-15 at the expense of other stages) for the process of creative problem solving. Therefore, this skill needs to be automated. If you have trained enough and developed approaches to solving certain types of problems, encountering a problem from a known class in a real interview, your brain quickly finds the direction you need to move in to find the optimal solution. 
On the other hand, the skill of finding an optimal solution is not the only important one for passing an interview. Several other separate skills can also be identified to train them more consciously/focused.

Important skills:
Listen attentively to the interviewer. To correctly understand the conditions of the problem, hear hints.
Comment on your train of thought, "think out loud" - clearly formulate what you have come up with or what is causing difficulty. 
Find the optimal solution to the problem. 
Quickly write code, know your language well (This skill is well honed on work tasks, I suggest we don't consider it further)

Participating in real interviews hones all these skills. Mock interviews are also effective but largely depend on the preparation level of the partner. 
If solving problems on leetcode by yourself should be good for practicing the skill of finding the optimal solution, then training to listen/comment is more effective with a partner or in a group. Group learning can also add additional motivation.

Let's take these skills and try to compile a table describing which training method is best for developing a specific skill.

|Method/Skill   | Listen carefully |"Think out loud"   |Find the optimal solution   |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real interview | +  | +  |  + |
| Mock interview  | +  | +  | +  |
| Self-practice on leetcode  | -  | -  |  + |
| Group Brainstorm  | +/-  | +/-  |  + |
