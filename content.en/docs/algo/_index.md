# How the Algorithm Practice Works

A group algorithm session lasts one hour. During this time, our goal is to solve two problems (medium, medium) or (easy, hard). We solve problems in a brainstorming mode in subgroups of 3-4 people.

## Step-by-step algorithm:

1. (before the meeting) In advance, before the meeting, participants can see events in the Google calendar, if you are coming to the meeting you need to mark the event (Going?) - yes, if you skip the session no. This mark is used for automatic subgroup division. If you answered yes, a link to the chat room for today's subgroup will appear in your personal calendar.
Links to the problems are published in the Telegram channel.
1. (duration 5min) We gather in the main room - participants join the Google Meet meetings: the main room and subgroup. Links are visible in the calendar. If on this day, less than 5 people marked yes under the general meeting, the session is conducted in the main room.
1. (duration 45min) In the main part of the session, we solve two problems. You need to give some time for everyone to read the conditions and ask clarifying questions. Then participants express their solution ideas. You can use collaborative editing services like codeshare to review examples.
1. (duration 10min) All participants from the subgroups move to the main room, where one of the participants in the subgroup briefly explains the found solution. Problems that we didn't manage to solve go into homework. 

After the meeting, you should briefly describe the chosen approaches for each problem in the Telegram channel. Record the conclusions, interesting ideas. This is necessary for better memorization of information.
