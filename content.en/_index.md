# Welcome! üéâ

Welcome aboard, algorithm researcher and systems design enthusiast! We have created this corner of the virtual world to dive together into the depths of technical knowledge in the IT industry. Our goal is to master and acquire fundamental knowledge, which will allow us to remain leaders in our field and be prepared for the most challenging interviews in large IT companies or technological startups.

# Motivation üí™

At present, large IT companies have set high standards for candidate assessment. But even an advanced specialist is unlikely to pass an interview without preparation. For instance, an algorithmic interview requires a large volume of theoretical knowledge and, importantly, a lot of practice solving problems. Systems design also requires extensive and up-to-date knowledge, but a specialist often works in a narrow area and does not touch on all possible architectural issues.

An interview is not just a knowledge check, but also a test of attention, the ability to clarify requirements and ask the right questions. Communication skills are also important: an interview requires commenting on your train of thought and arguing decisions. In addition, the interviewer assesses you as a future colleague, how comfortable and interesting it will be for them to work with you.
Therefore, accumulating knowledge is not the only goal of our community members. It is also important to develop meta-skills: learnability, creativity, critical thinking, constructive dialogue, resilience in overcoming problems in conditions of limited time.

Within the community, we are looking for the most effective approaches and tools. One of the discovered effective approaches is group training in brainstorming mode. This approach allows participants to discuss ideas, build arguments, and suggest their methods for solving problems, which develops the skill of explaining their decision and commenting on the thought process.

# Schedule ‚è∞

We conduct joint training twice a week, with each session lasting about an hour. This regime does not create stress for participants, allows combining preparation with work, and also ensures a stable result in the long term. During the month in classes, we solve 10 Leetcode problems and deeply study 3 system design topics.

## Participation is free, the group is sustained by the enthusiasm of its members!
